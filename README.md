# Quiz Game using OOP

## Description
This project is a simple command-line quiz application built in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It presents a series of questions to the user, keeps track of their score, and displays the final score after all questions have been answered. The quiz logic is managed through dedicated classes, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

## Features
- Presents a series of questions to the user.
- Keeps track of the user's score.
- Displays the final score once all questions have been answered.
- Utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) for better structure and maintainability.

## How It Works
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The application uses OOP principles to structure the code. Key components include:
- Question class: Represents a single quiz question and its answer.
- QuizBrain class: Manages the quiz flow, tracks the score, and determines when the quiz is complete.
- The main.py script coordinates the quiz by creating instances of these classes and controlling the flow of the quiz.
